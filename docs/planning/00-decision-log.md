# Decision Log

Architecture and product decisions for **FPL DOF** (Fantasy Premier League Director of Football).
Newest entries at the bottom. Each decision is immutable once accepted — to change one, add a
superseding entry and mark the original `Superseded by DL-nn`.

| **Status** | `Accepted` / `Superseded` / `Proposed` |
| **Date** | Date the decision was taken |
| **Decided by** | Who made the call |

## DL-01 — Season objective is the 2026/27 campaign, starting at GW1

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-09 · **Decided by:** Owner

The product exists to maximise points across the **2026/27 Premier League season**. Season starts
Friday **21 August 2026**; the **GW1 deadline is 18:30 BST on 21 August 2026**. Chip set 1 expires at
the GW19 deadline (13:30 GMT, Saturday 2 January 2027). Final match round is Sunday 30 May 2027.

**Consequence:** the season calendar, not a sprint calendar, is the project's master clock. Every
milestone is expressed relative to gameweek deadlines.

## DL-02 — This engagement produces planning documentation only

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-09 · **Decided by:** Owner

No implementation code is written yet. Deliverables are the charter, plan/blueprint, architecture and
conceptual design. Build cadence is decided after review.

**Consequence:** the plan carries two tracks — a **GW1 fast lane** (viable only if build starts almost
immediately) and a **full build** track — so the decision can be taken with the trade-offs visible.
See [02-project-plan-and-blueprint.md](02-project-plan-and-blueprint.md) §7.

## DL-03 — Static site plus scheduled jobs; no always-on server

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-09 · **Decided by:** Owner

Scheduled CI jobs (GitHub Actions) ingest data, run models and the optimiser, and publish
**precomputed static artefacts**. A static single-page app served from a CDN reads those artefacts.
There is no application server, no managed database and no runtime backend.

**Rejected alternatives:** serverless full-stack on a free tier (account limits, cold starts, free-tier
database pausing); self-hosted at home (machine must stay on, ops burden); hybrid CI + small API
(more moving parts than the benefit justifies at this scale).

**Consequence:** interactive "what-if" re-optimisation must run **client-side in the browser** or be
triggered as a CI job. This is an explicit architectural constraint, addressed in
[03-solution-architecture.md](03-solution-architecture.md) §4 and §9.

## DL-04 — Python for data and analytics, TypeScript/React for the web app

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-09 · **Decided by:** Owner

Ingestion, transformation, modelling and optimisation in Python (pandas, scikit-learn/LightGBM,
PuLP/HiGHS). Front end in TypeScript with React and Vite.

**Rejected alternatives:** all-TypeScript (weak optimisation and ML ecosystem for a multi-gameweek
MILP); Python end-to-end with Streamlit/Dash (weaker mobile UX for the scouting experience, which is
a first-class requirement).

**Consequence:** a two-language monorepo with a strictly defined **data contract** at the boundary —
Python only ever writes versioned JSON/Parquet; the front end never calls a Python process.

---

## DL-05 — Data sources: FPL API, Understat/FBref, bookmaker odds — behind a pluggable adapter layer

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-09 · **Decided by:** Owner

Launch sources are the **official FPL API**, **Understat/FBref** advanced statistics, and **bookmaker
odds**. The owner explicitly required a *modular and extensible design to enable easy onboarding of
future data sources*.

**Consequence:** source adapters are a first-class architectural component with a formal interface,
registry and conformance test suite. No model or application code may reference a source directly;
everything consumes the conformed silver layer. Adding a source must not require changes outside its
own adapter module plus a config entry — this is a testable design constraint, specified in
[04-conceptual-design.md](04-conceptual-design.md) §14.

---

## DL-06 — Decision engine is a multi-gameweek MILP with explicit chip planning

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-09 · **Decided by:** Owner

A mixed-integer linear program maximises discounted expected points over a rolling 5–8 gameweek
horizon, subject to full FPL rules: budget and selling-price mechanics, squad composition, the
three-per-club limit, formation legality, free-transfer accrual and rollover to a maximum of five,
−4 point hits, and the timing of Wildcard, Free Hit, Triple Captain and Bench Boost.

**Rejected alternatives:** single-gameweek optimisation (structurally short-sighted — churns transfers
and mistimes chips); fully stochastic scenario optimisation as the *initial* core (too heavy for CI
compute limits before the deterministic core is proven).

**Consequence:** the expected-points interface must expose **variance as well as mean** from day one,
so a distributional/simulation layer can be added later without reworking the optimiser.

---

## DL-07 — Objective is expected points with a selectable, rank-aware risk dial

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-09 · **Decided by:** Owner

The core objective is expected points. A user-facing risk setting adjusts the objective between
**safe** (hug the template, manage effective ownership to protect rank) and **aggressive** (seek
low-ownership differentials). The ownership bet implied by every recommendation is surfaced in the UI.

**Consequence:** ownership and effective ownership are modelled entities, not display fields, and the
optimiser objective carries a tunable ownership-deviation term.

---

## DL-08 — Single user, any team ID, public endpoints only

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-09 · **Decided by:** Owner

One user. The FPL team ID is configuration, not a hardcoded constant, so any public team can be
loaded — enabling mini-league and rival analysis. **No authentication, no accounts, no FPL
credentials and no personal data are stored or transmitted.**

**Consequence:** the authenticated `my-team` endpoint is out of scope. Current-squad state before a
deadline must be reconstructed from the last finished gameweek's public picks plus the public
transfers feed, with a manual override path. This is a known functional gap, designed for explicitly
in [04-conceptual-design.md](04-conceptual-design.md) §4.3.

---

## DL-09 — Documentation lives as Markdown in the repository

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-09 · **Decided by:** Owner

All project documentation is Markdown under `docs/`, version-controlled alongside the code. No
externally published copies.

**Consequence:** diagrams use Mermaid so they render in GitHub and IDE preview without a toolchain.
Documents are expected to be read by AI coding agents as well as humans, so requirements are
numbered and traceable.

## Open decisions

Decisions deliberately deferred, with the point at which each must be resolved.

| ID | Question | Must resolve by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OD-01 | Public or private GitHub repository — public gives unlimited Actions minutes and free Pages; private costs minutes and needs a paid plan for Pages | Phase 0, before first CI run |
| OD-02 | GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages for hosting | Phase 5 |
| OD-03 | Which odds provider and free-tier credit budget | Phase 1 |
| OD-04 | Whether to add injury/press-conference feeds as a fourth source | Phase 6, in-season |
| OD-05 | Target overall rank — determines how aggressively the risk dial should default | Before GW1 squad is locked |
